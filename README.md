## Titanic Survivability Prediction

This project aims to predict the survivability of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning models, with a focus on handling missing values in the dataset.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the classic Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, and passenger class.

## Methodology

We employed three types of classifiers:

* **Linear Regression Models:** Logistic Regression was used.
* **Tree Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forests, and CatBoost were utilized.
* **Neural Networks:** A simple feedforward neural network was implemented using `scikit-learn` and `Keras/Tensorflow`.

Missing values were handled using statistical imputation and various other techniques.

The evaluation metric used was accuracy.

## Libraries Used

* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
* `numpy`: For numerical computations.
* `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and evaluation
* `catboost`: For gradient boosting, particularly effective with categorical features.
