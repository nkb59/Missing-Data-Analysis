# Missing-Values-Dataset-Analysis

The dataset used for this assignment is the infamous Titanic dataset which is used to teach many
students worldwide about missing values in a dataset.

The goal of this assignment is to try and predict the survivability rate of the passengers
dependent on different features in the dataset such as sex, age, passenger class, etcâ€¦

We explore different ways of handling missing values in datasets using 3 types of classifiers:
1. Linear Regression Models
2. Tree Models
3. Neural Networks

***See the attached PDF for a comprehensive overview of this project.***

Python libraries used: **scikit, numpy, pandas, catboost**
